Henry Senger and Cornelius Beach Bradley; Stanford Universitys David Starr Jordan; artist William Keith; and attorney Warren Olney. Many of the clubs 182 charter members are scientists, and LeContes maps of the Sierra range are among its first publications. media-body1895Nutrition scienceNutrition science /.modal-content  /.modal-dialog M.E.

Goldberg subsequently achieves immortality, and a Pulitzer Prize, for his drawings making light of the discipline he studied. Today, the cartoonists absurdly complex mechanisms for accomplishing simple tasks have become so ingrained in popular culture that his name appears in the dictionary as an adjective. media-body1907Cleaner smokestacksCleaner smokestacks /.modal-content  /.modal-dialog Frederick G.

A memorial tablet was placed on the stone in 1896. The Big ""C"" in the hills above campus was built in 1905 by the 1907 and 1908 classes. Sophomores were responsible for keeping the C clean and painted gold. On the night before a Stanford game or coast championship, the C was guarded through the night. At the Big Game of 1914, colored cards supplied to Cal fans were held up in the rooting section according to direction to make a pattern. Over time card stunts became more elaborate, including the ""Cal script,"" in which a huge ""Cal"" appeared to be written.Cal band performs for the Free Speech Movement anniversary (Play Video)Press ESC to close video dialogTo share this video via email, copy and paste the message and URL below into your favorite email client and send. /.modal-content  /.modal-dialog  /#videoModal  In 1895 a 12-man track team became the first Cal team to compete outside the state. They carried banners with the stateas emblem, a grizzly bear, in gold. The athletes won several meets, and the Golden Bear became the mythical guardian of the university. Beloved mascot Oski was named for a cheer that began, ""Oski wow wow! Whiskey wee wee!"" Originally, real bear cubs served as mascots, but their growth posed obvious problems. Oski as we know him debuted at a 1941 freshman rally.

Quizzes, projects and activities are not scheduled to allow time to study and prepare for exams. The tree in front of the Wheeler Hall steps was a favorite meeting place for students between 1917 and 1934, when the oak had to be removed because of its age.
