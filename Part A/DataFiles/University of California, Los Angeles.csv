Here, youall find an overview of some of the more significant and well-known national and international rankings.#1Public UniversityU.S. News & World Report, 2021UCLA is the No. 1 public university, and is ranked 20th among all national universities in the U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges rankings. The U.S. News & World Report rankings, despite their popularity, tell only part of the story. They place more emphasis on factors that tend to favor private universities, such as endowment size, rate of alumni giving and student-faculty ratios. Nevertheless, they can be a useful tool that focuses largely on factors related to undergraduate education.#9World Reputation RankingTimes Higher Education, 2020UCLA ranked 9th out of 100 universities in the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings. Distinct from the annual World University Rankings, these rankings are derived solely from the opinions of senior, published academics from around the globe.#13Global RankingU.S. News & World Report, 2021U.S. News introduced a new global ranking of universities in 2014. The methodology for this ranking is very different from the publicationas U.S. ranking system. It gives much more weight to academic research and reputation, as well as graduate and professional school quality.#13Academic Ranking of World UniversitiesShanghai Jiao Tong University, 2020More than 1,200 institutions are evaluated in this ranking, which is based heavily on faculty publications and citations, as well as the number of alumni and faculty who have won Nobel Prizes.#15World University RankingsTimes Higher Education, 2021UCLA was 15th overall among the top 1,102 universities in the world in the respected Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The rankings rely on performance indicators such as the quality of teaching, research and the international mix of staff and students.#4Best Value UniversityForbes Magazine, 2019In 2019 (the most recent ranking), Forbes evaluates colleges and universities based on alumni earnings, net price, net student debt, school quality, timely graduation and the number of Pell Grant recipients.Forbes revised its methodology in 2018 to put more emphasis on the surveyas three financial factors  earnings, price and debt  and the publication switched to net price (which takes into account the impact of studentsa financial aid and the costs of room and board) instead of list price.#9Top American Research UniversitiesCenter for Measuring University Performance, 2019In 2019 (the most recent ranking), the center placed UCLA among the nationas top research universities  both public and private. This ranking focuses on nine key measures of university research performance, including competitively awarded research grants and contracts, faculty membership in the National Academies, faculty awards, the number of doctorates awarded and other factors. UCLA was ranked in the top 25 among all research universities in seven of these measures, including:40Top-Ranked Doctoral Research ProgramsNational Research Council, 2010In 2010 (the most recent ranking), the National Research Council (NRC) compiled the premier assessment of the nationas doctoral research programs.

He pushed student athletes to become better teammates and, more importantly, better people by upholding a code of honesty, integrity and loyalty. Coach Woodenas aPyramid of Successa also led to four undefeated seasons and 10 national championships a more than any other coach in college basketball history.From Jackie Robinson, Troy Aikman and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Ann Meyers Drysdale and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, UCLA alumni are icons, record breakers, award winners, world champions and game changers in that same mold.
