Under university policy and federal and state law students have privacy rights. There is no general exception for notifying parents unless the student has given written consent or there is a serious concern about the health and welfare of the student. Exceptions may include transportation to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. But campus officials can only make that call if they know about the incident. If the situation doesnat come to the attention of the campus for several days and a student is no longer in immediate danger parents may not be contacted. Campus officials will usually contact parents if a student threatens or attempts suicide. If a student is removed from residence halls for misconduct and the student has nowhere to go parents may also be notified. Federal regulations protect the privacy of student medical and educational records. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA sets safeguards around personal health information in the United States. While students can access their own health records UC Davis cannot disclose information from health records to other individuals even family members without written authorization from the student. However in a health or safety emergency the university may share information with other people to protect the health or safety of the student or others. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or FERPA puts similar measures in place for all records including academic grades and health records directly related to students. Like HIPAA FERPA requires all public universities to obtain explicit signed consent from the student for most disclosures of identifiable information from his or her educational record. Although parents have special rights under FERPA for K-12 education the rights previously held by parents and guardians are transferred to the student upon enrollment in a UC Davis academic program. Some information a such as a studentas major dates of attendance and degree awarded a is considered public and can be disclosed unless the student has designated themselves aall records confidential.a A studentas telephone number and email address may be released unless the student has designated the record as adirectory confidential.a For medical interns less information is considered public.
