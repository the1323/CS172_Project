At UCI we make a world-class education available to all talented, hardworking students, regardless of background. In so doing, we remind the country that great universities can reinvigorate the American dream by becoming the most powerful engines of social mobility ever created. UCI Chancellor Howard GillmanMoney Magazine - #1 Best CollegeIn 2019 magazine named UCI No. 1 on its annual list of the nations Best Colleges, making it the first public university to achieve the top spot. The ranking acknowledges UCIs continued commitment to providing accessible, high-quality education and fostering alumni success. The campus scored well across the board but especially in the measures of low-income and Pell Grant enrollment and favorable graduate outcomes  reflecting UCIs role in advancing upward social mobility and doing the most for the American dream.    I can dreamUCI a Advancing the American dreamOne of the thorniest problems in society is the vanishing American dream. Its no secret that a college degree is the best way for young adults to catapult themselves from a disadvantaged past to a better future. But that path is increasingly elusive.Too many of Americas best colleges and universities enroll more students from the wealthiest 1 percent of families than from the bottom 60 percent. This imbalance damages the U.S. economy, widens the gulf between rich and poor, and goes against a fundamental mission of universities: to empower and expand opportunities for everyone.UCI has won national praise for its success in breaking this pattern and creating an educational big tent. This website highlights some of the personal student stories, national rankings, diversity outreach programs and other elements of UCIs quest to make the American dream more attainable for all.Forbes Highest UpwardMobility RatesForbes ranks UCI 4th in nation for best value Doing the most for the American dreamFor the second consecutive year, UCI tops  College Access Index of U.S. universities based on their commitment to economic diversity. The ranking takes into account the number of low- and middle-income students that a college enrolls and the price it charges them.Were thrilled to once again be recognized as the leading campus in the United States providing access to all qualified students, no matter what their background.UCI Chancellor Howard GillmanInclusion and diversityNo matter what your background is, youll feel at home at UCI.
